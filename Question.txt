Sandun is a wine lover. He had to be in his home for three months due to the Covid-19 situation. Sandun
wants to buy some wine since the curfew has been lifted. He goes to his favorite wine yard with some
empty bottles. Wine yard owner is pleased to see Sandun. Hence, he offers Sandun free wine on one
condition. Sandun can fill only the bottles he carries in his bag.
